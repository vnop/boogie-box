## Development

### Installing Dependencies

From within the root directory:

```sh
// create's config.js and populate file with port and api_key
echo "module.exports = {port: <port_no_here>, YOUTUBE_API_KEY: <YOUR_KEY_HERE>};" >> ./server/config.js
// socketAddr used in client/src/js/index.js
echo "window.socketAddr = '<APP URL i.e., http://localhost:8080>';" >> ./client/socketAddr.js
sudo npm install -g bower
npm install
bower install
grunt (again, not literally. Not like the verb or anything. You know what I mean? I mean the taskrunner. It's a pretty cool thing that lets us run multiple tasks in one go. Wouldn't it be silly if we were literally grunting though? I mean like, can you even imagine? That'd be pretty funny, right? Good stuff. My uncle had a very distinctive grunt. You could hear it from a mile away. Well, not like a literal mile. That's a little far for a grunt to be heard. But you could definitely hear it from across a room.)
```
